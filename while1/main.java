//The bot is going through a financial catastrophe! It's holding 10,000 great british pounds.*
//        It wants to sell all of these as soon as possible! Before the state of Britain collapses, but it's a bit greedy.
//        It will only sell its pounds when the exchange rate is greater than 1.15 (poundToEuro)
//        On days where it sells, it can only sell 1000 pounds for euros.
//        Write a while loop
//        Use the calculation for exchange rate below
//        1 + (Math.random() * 0.2);
//        To recalculate our rate every day (once per loop)
//        Print the number of days it takes for our bot to sell its pounds
